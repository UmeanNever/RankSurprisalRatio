## 📋 Overview

In this work, we investigate data–student suitability in reasoning distillation and introduce **Rank-Surprisal Ratio** (RSR), a simple yet effective metric for **identifying suitable reasoning trajectories for a given student**.  

RSR is defined as the ratio of a trajectory’s average token-wise rank to its average negative log-likelihood (surprisal), and **is straightforward to compute and interpret**.

- 🛠️ **Code**: Available in this repository, providing **a clean and efficient implementation for computing the RSR metric**.
- 📀 **Data**: Available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Umean/RSR_data). We release 33 math reasoning trajectory datasets used in our experiments, generated by 11 different teacher models. We also release RSR-selected datasets for 5 student models. These datasets can be directly used for reasoning distillation.

</p>

Motivated by our analysis, RSR jointly captures a trajectory's informativeness and alignment with the student’s behavior, favoring trajectories with low absolute probability but relatively high-ranked tokens.

Across five student models and reasoning trajectories from 11 diverse teachers, RSR strongly correlates with post-training reasoning performance (**average Spearman 0.86**), consistently outperforming existing metrics. We further demonstrate its practical utility in both **trajectory selection** and **teacher selection**.

For more information and a detailed introduction to RSR, please refer to our paper.

## 🚀 Quick Start
Our codebase supports the computation of our lightweight suitability metric, the **Rank-Surprisal Ratio** (RSR), given teacher trajectories and student models. The code has been cleaned up from our original implementation and streamlined to focus on RSR computation.

- `rsr_launch.py` serves as the **entry-point** script for computing RSR. You can modify the global variables in this file according to your experimental setup and then run it to start the computation. Please refer to the provided datasets for the expected data format.  
- `rsr_cal.py` implements the core computation logic. It includes placeholders and explanatory comments to facilitate easy customization.

The current implementation has minimal dependencies, relying primarily on `torch` and `transformers`. While not strictly required, we recommend the following Python environment configuration:

* torch==2.7.0
* transformers==4.53.3
* flash-attn==2.8.3 (optional, but substantially boosts speed)
* Python 3.12
* CUDA 12.8

See `requirements.txt` for the complete list of Python package dependencies. You can install them using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. We recommend installing `flash-attn` via pre-built wheels corresponding to your specific Python, CUDA, and PyTorch environment.

In our experiments, computing RSR over the 5,000-trajectory dataset with a context length of 32,768 using a 7B
model typically takes under one hour on a single H200 GPU with FlashAttention enabled. For further computational details, see Appendix C.1 of our paper.
